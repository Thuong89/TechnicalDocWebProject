# TechnicalDocWebProject
This is a project to adopt HTML and CSS techniques learnt from Freecodecamp to create a technical document webpage. Below are HTML CSS techniques applied:
HTML:
-  tag main
- tag header
- tag section
- nav bar
- using div tag
- anchor link tag a href="#id" to the assigned section
- using tag code
- creating order list


CSS:
- flex box
- media query
- set box, color, style, margin, etc

Note: content of this page is taken from the internet. Since applying the HTML and CSS techniques is the main purpose, the content of text is just for the sake of filling in the example.
